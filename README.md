# üêå Otis' Death and Knockouts Script

Hello hello! If you're here to download the script for your server, head over to the releases tab and pick up a ready-to-go copy! If you're here for some info on the script, feel free to read along!

This script was designed with a goal to enhance the RP ability of deaths and knockouts in FiveM. In the base client, you automatically respawn, and you can't get knocked out either. All of the other scripts that implement this just didn't really fit my liking, so I decided to take a crack at it.

So yeah, you can get curbstomped now... lol.

Feedback and PRs are totally welcome! This is my first time releasing a FiveM script to the public, so I tried my best to make everything as readable as possible, but if you have any improvements or additional implementation that you think might improve the functionality of this resource, feel free to make a PR.

Info below.

# üìùInformation

- Knockouts
    - Knockouts, by default, are enabled and occur when a player has received a hit by a blunt weapon that brings them below the configured health threshold. (Default: 145; 50%)
    - When a player is knocked out, their screen blinks black, and two timecycles are applied along with an audio of ears ringing through NUI.
    - The list of "weapons" that cause knockouts can been seen below:
        - Bat
        - Crowbar
        - Fists
